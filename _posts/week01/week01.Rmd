### Before next time

- Please [sign up for two collaborative note slots](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xjLpsYCh0u9n-Hm7T_z2F3Kb_qo7MgnGtSB8HaFaamk/edit?usp=sharing)

- Make sure all software is installed and working

- Connect Git and GitHub following the directions in the [GitHub Classroom Guide for Stat 220](github_stat220.html)(you only need to worry about the "Getting setup with Git and GitHub" for now.)

- Read [Sections 2.2-2.13 in Irizazary](https://rafalab.github.io/dsbook/r-basics.html#the-very-basics). This reviews the basics of working with vectors in R. Feel free to skip the exercises for now, focus on reviewing the basics.

- Read [Sections 27.1-27.5 in R4DS](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html#r-markdown). This reviews and expands on using R Markdown for literate programming. 

- Watch "Git and GitHub for Poets (part 1)". This introduces 
basic ideas, but we'll use RStudio to interface with Git and GitHub.

Optional (if you need more review):

- If you don't remember how to use R Markdown from your last statistics class, read [R and RStudio Basics](https://ismayc.github.io/rbasics-book/3-rstudiobasics.html) and [R Markdown](https://ismayc.github.io/rbasics-book/4-rmarkdown.html) from *Getting Used to R, RStudio, and R Markdown*

- If it's been a LONG time since you used R and need a crash course on the very basics, watch this [programming basics primer from RStudio](https://rstudio.cloud/learn/primers/1.2).
