  This is a brief overview of how to store your GitHub PAT so that
  you can more easily work with GitHub via RStudio.

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE, eval=FALSE)
```

After you have signed up for a GitHub account and gone through all of the account verification steps, you will need to generate a personal access token (PAT) and let R know what that is. To do this, I suggest following these steps:

1. Setup options in Git by running the following code chunk in your console:

    ```{r}
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name = "Jane Doe", user.email = "jane@example.org")
```
    changing the first two lines to your own name and email (this should be the email associated with your GitHub account).

2. Next, you should generate a PAT:

    ```{r}
create_github_token()
```

    This function will preselect the recommended scopes. I recommend just clicking "Generate token" unless you know of a reason to tweak the scopes. Store this token somewhere, because youâ€™ll never be able to see it again once you leave that page or close the window. Treat this PAT like a password.

3. Now that you have credentials, you need to store them. I recommend using the `{gitcreds}` package. Run the below chunk (after installing the package if you're using your own laptop):

    ```{r}
library(gitcreds)
gitcreds_set()
```

    Respond to the prompt with your personal access token (PAT).

4. You should be setup! Try to clone a GitHub project and talk to me if you still hit issues.
