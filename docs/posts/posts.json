This reviews and expands on using R Markdown for literate programming.\nWatch “Git and GitHub for Poets (part 1)”. This introduces basic ideas, but we’ll use RStudio to interface with Git and GitHub.\n\nOptional (if you need more review):\nIf you don’t remember how to use R Markdown from your last statistics class, read R and RStudio Basics and R Markdown from Getting Used to R, RStudio, and R Markdown\nIf it’s been a LONG time since you used R and need a crash course on the very basics, watch this programming basics primer from RStudio.\nFriday, 17 Sept\nAnnouncements\nHomework 1 is due by 8:30 a.m. on Wednesday, September 22.\nTopics/activities\nSlides: html | pdf\nExample .Rmd report (for your turns)\nCollaborative notes\nReproducible workflows\nGetting up and running with R Markdown\nConnecting to GitHub\nBefore next time\nMake sure that you have access to homework 1 on GitHub. You can start working on it now, but it won’t be due until Wednesday (notice that change in due date). I’ll also review how to clone the project and use GitHub on Monday.\nWatch this video on the R fundamentals (here are the slides) or read Sections 2.2-2.13 in Irizazary, whichever works best for your learning style. These materials review the fundamentals of working with vectors in R. Feel free to skip the exercises for now, focus on reviewing the basics.\n\n\n\n\n",

I’m happy to help with troubleshooting during student hours.\nSign up for a GitHub account using your Carleton email: https://github.com/. I recommend choosing a username that incorporates your name (e.g. aloy or AdamLoy).\nEdit your GitHub profile. Please add your name and a cropped picture of you (to help me learn names faster).\nSign up for Slack following the directions on the guide. Once you have joined the class workspace, go to the “discussion” channel and introduce yourself.\nFill out this pre-class survey. You’ll submit your GitHub username here, so be sure to complete the other steps first!\n\n\n\n",
