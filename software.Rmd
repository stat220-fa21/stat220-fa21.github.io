## R/RStudio

The use of the R programming language with the RStudio interface is an
essential component of this course. You have two options for using
RStudio:

-   The **server version** of RStudio on the web at
    (<https://maize.mathcs.carleton.edu>). The advantage of using the
    server version is that all of your work will be stored in the cloud,
    where it is automatically saved and backed up. This means that you
    can access your work from any computer on campus using a web
    browser. The downside is that you have to share limited
    computational resources with each other! This limitation is
    especially pronounced this term when classes are being taught
    remotely. We are unsure what type of load will be placed on maize,
    so if you can download a local version of R and RStudio, I recommend
    you do so. Use your Carleton credentials to access your account and
    you need to be running the Carleton VPN (below) to access this
    server.

-   A **local version** of RStudio installed on your machine. This
    option is highly recommended due to the computational resources this
    course demands. The downside to this approach is that your work is
    only stored locally, but I get around this problem by keeping all of
    my work on GitHub. You will learn how to use GitHub throughout the
    course. Both R and RStudio are free and open-source.

    **Installing R/RStudio (not needed if you are using the maize
    server)**

    -   Download the latest version of R: <https://cran.r-project.org/>

    -   Download the free Rstudio desktop version:
        <https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/>

    Use the default download and install options for each. For R,
    download the "precompiled binary" distribution rather than the
    source code

    **Updating R/RStudio (not needed if you are using the maize
    server)**

    If you have used a local version of R/RStudio before and it is still
    installed on your machine, then you should make sure that you have
    the most recent versions of each program.

    -   To check your version of R, run the command `getRversion()` and
        compare your version to the newest version posted on
        <https://cran.r-project.org/>. If you need an update, then
        install the newer version using the installation directions
        above.

    -   In RStudio, check for updates with the menu option
        `Help > Check for updates`. Follow directions if an update is
        needed.

    ### Did it work? (A sanity check after your install/update)

    Do whatever is appropriate for your operating system to launch
    RStudio. You should get a window similar to the screenshot you see
    [here](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/rstudio-workbench.png),
    but yours will be more boring because you haven't written any code
    or made any figures yet!

    Put your cursor in the pane labeled Console, which is where you
    interact with the live R process. Create a simple object with code
    like `x <- 2 * 4` (followed by enter or return). Then inspect the
    `x` object by typing `x` followed by enter or return. You should see
    the value 8 printed. If this happened, you've succeeded in
    installing R and RStudio!



## Git and GitHub

[Git](https://happygitwithr.com/big-picture.html#why-git) is version
control software that you install locally on your computer. Git is
already installed on the maize RStudio server.

[Github](https://happygitwithr.com/big-picture.html#why-github) is a
cloud-based service for hosting git projects. It allows multiple users
to share and contribute to projects and it is how you will be submitting
homework assignments and projects for this class. More information about
Github for this class is found in [Getting setup with Git and
GitHub](git_stat220.md).

If you are using a local install of R/RStudio, then you will need to
install Git.

**Installing Git**

Directions for both Windows & Mac here:
<http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html>.

-   If you are using **maize**, then there is nothing you need to
    install.

-   Windows users should follow Option 1 in 6.2.

-   Mac users can follow Option 1 in 6.3 if comfortable, otherwise
    follow Option 2

-   Linux users can follow 6.4.



## Slack

We will use Slack for all course communication. [Sign up for our course
Slack team
here](https://join.slack.com/t/stat220-fa21/shared_invite/zt-uvpbbjgj-cyr3olDzY~s7PkaY~Vu7Sg)!
You will need to create an account with a username, and log in to read
and post. You can use Slack right from a [web
browser](https://stat220-fa21.slack.com), or you can download a
standalone Slack application to your
[Mac](https://slack.com/downloads/osx),
[Windows](https://slack.com/downloads/windows),
[Linux](https://slack.com/downloads/linux) and/or
[Android](https://slack.com/downloads/android)/[iOS](https://slack.com/downloads/ios)
device. You can control whether you receive notifications on new posts
by going to Preferences, as well as decide which 'channels' to subscribe
to. A 'channel' is a discussion thread, which is used to organize
communications into topics. You can learn more about Slack features
[here](https://slack.com/help/articles/218080037-Getting-started-for-new-Slack-users).

Several channels have been set up for specific parts of the course. Feel
free to ask questions anytime. You can browse the available channels in
our team by clicking on "Channels" on the left-hand panel.

There is also an \#anonymous channel that you can use if you'd like to
ask a question or provide a comment anonymously. To have a post appear
anonymously in this channel, compose a direct message to yourself (by
clicking on your username in the 'Direct Messages' menu on the left
panel) that begins with /anon \#anonymous your question. Then the text
your question will be sent to the \#anonymous channel by the anonymous
bot. Zoom For synchronous class meeting and office hours we will use the
Zoom video conferencing software. I recommend downloading the Zoom app
for your operating system.



## LaTeX

If you want to render R Markdown documents to PDFs, then you need to
install LaTeX. Below are the recommended installers for Windows and Mac:

-   [MacTeX](https://www.tug.org/mactex/) for Mac (3.2GB)

-   [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/download) for Windows (190MB)

-   Alternatively, you can install the `tinytex` R package by running
    `install.packages("tinytex")` in the console.

If you are using maize, then there is nothing you need to install.



## Panopto

At some point in the course, you will need to create a screencast
presenting results or demonstrating your data product. Carleton supports
the Panopto software for this purpose. For more information, including
an installation guide, check out thisÂ [set of
videos](https://apps.carleton.edu/campus/its/services/learning/lecture-capture/)
on Panopto.
